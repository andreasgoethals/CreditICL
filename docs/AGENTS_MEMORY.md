# Agents' memory — runs and dead ends

What is worth carrying between sessions: **the cluster runs that have been done**, and **the things
that turned out not to work**. Read it before starting; add to it as you go.

Not the changelog — that records edits to the repository. This records experience: what was run,
what came out, and what is already known to fail.

**Keep it short.** One line per run, four per dead end. Newest first, dates `DD-MM-YYYY`. Never
delete an entry: a run you would otherwise repeat and a dead end you already paid for are both
evidence.

## Runs

One row per cluster run worth remembering — which is most of them, because *"have we already tried
that configuration?"* is the question this table exists to answer.

| Date | Run | Outcome | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

**The table starts empty on purpose, and that is not the same as "nothing has run".** Submission
attempts were made on wICE before 11-08-2026 and their logs were read to fix the bugs recorded
below, but no row was ever written and those logs are no longer on disk, so there is nothing here
that can be trusted. **Add a row for every run from now on**, at submission time rather than
afterwards — a job that dies at the walltime never comes back to write its own entry.

- **Run** — the config or arm, and the commit if it matters.
- **Outcome** — `done` / `walltime` / `OOM` / `crashed` / `diverged` / `cancelled`.
- **Notes** — one line: the headline number, the output path if it is worth finding again, or the
  single thing the run showed. A number here saves re-reading `output/results/`.

## Dead ends

Anything that cost more than a couple of minutes and did not work — including what you eventually
fixed, because the fix is one changelog line and the dead end was the hour.

### 11-08-2026 — Vendoring NanoTabICL instead of TabICL itself
- **Tried:** built the model from `NanoTabICL.txt` (665 lines) because it is small and readable,
  then tried to load the released TabICLv2 checkpoint into it for the warm-start experiment.
- **Result:** **zero of 390 parameter names matched** any of the checkpoint's 347, and our model
  had 44 extra LayerNorm bias tensors. `load_state_dict` loads nothing and does not complain.
- **Why:** NanoTabICL is a *reimplementation*, not the code that wrote the checkpoint. The bias
  gap is the `--norm_type layernorm_nobias` flag from upstream's own stage script, which a
  reimplementation without that switch cannot express.
- **Instead:** `tfm-library/repositories/TabICL.txt` is the **real** repository — 127 files,
  32,794 lines, including `_model/tabicl.py`, the whole `prior/`, **and** `train/_run.py`,
  `train/_muon.py` and `scripts/train_v2_reg_stage{1,2,3}.sh`. Use their model and loop; keep our
  prior as the thing that changes. Cheap check: count matching `state_dict` keys before writing
  any adapter — one line, and it would have ended this in a minute.

### 11-08-2026 — Running anything with the bare `python` on this machine
- **Tried:** `python -m src.utils.run_notebooks` from the repo root.
- **Result:** all 3 notebooks failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'`.
- **Why:** bare `python` on this machine is `C:\Python314\python.exe` — **Python 3.14**, outside
  the project's own `>=3.11,<3.13` pin, and with none of the dependencies. The project venv is
  `.CreditICL/`, which was never on PATH.
- **Instead:** always `.CreditICL/Scripts/python.exe`. Check `sys.version` before believing an
  import error is a code bug.

### 11-08-2026 — Every figure drawn at roughly twice the page width
- **Tried:** hard-coded `figsize=(12, 4.6)`, `(13, 3.8)`, `(11.5, 7.4)` in the plot modules, which
  look right on screen.
- **Result:** the A4 text block is **6.30 in**. Every figure would be scaled to ~50 % in the
  document, taking 9pt text to ~4.5pt — below the ~7pt floor for print.
- **Why:** a screen has no fixed width, so nothing pushes back until the figure is on a page.
- **Instead:** sizes come only from `style.figsize` / `grid_figsize` / `row_figsize`.
  `test_no_plot_function_hard_codes_a_figure_size` and `test_every_saved_pdf_fits_the_a4_text_block`
  now measure the PDFs themselves.

### 11-08-2026 — `results_dir()` on the wrong storage tier
- **Tried:** `results_dir()` returning `outputs_dir() / "results"`.
- **Result:** per-row predictions would have gone to `$VSC_DATA` (75 GiB) instead of project
  storage, filling it — and once it is full, every job that writes a log fails too.
- **Why:** `outputs_dir()` is correct for logs, manifests and figures, which are small. `results/`
  is the one part of `output/` that is not.
- **Instead:** `results_dir()` honours the staging root. `test_results_are_the_one_part_of_output_on_project_storage`
  asserts both halves, because moving *everything* to staging is the opposite mistake.

### 11-08-2026 — A test writing into the real `output/` tree
- **Tried:** isolating a figure test with `monkeypatch.setenv("CREDITICL_STAGING_ROOT", tmp_path)`.
- **Result:** two 1-byte fake PDFs left in `output/figures/`, which the A4 size check then read
  as real figures with no MediaBox. The failure surfaced three test files away from its cause.
- **Why:** `figures_dir()` hangs off `outputs_dir()`, which **ignores staging** — only `results/`
  follows it. Setting the staging root alone isolates a quarter of the tree.
- **Instead:** the `isolated_output` fixture sets `VSC_DATA` *and* the staging root. Use it for any
  test that writes.

### Earlier — SLURM dependency chain spanning three clusters
- **Tried:** one submit script chaining wICE → Genius → Mindwell → wICE.
- **Result:** the chain broke; the user's actual error was a Genius stage with **no `--partition`**.
- **Why:** VSC job dependencies **do not cross clusters**, and Genius needs an explicit partition.
- **Instead:** all of Phase 1 stays on wICE. A chain that spans clusters has to be resubmitted by
  hand at the boundary, so do not build one.

### Earlier — `sbatch --parsable` in a dependency expression
- **Tried:** `dep=$(sbatch --parsable job.slurm)`.
- **Result:** malformed dependencies — the value is `jobid;cluster`, not `jobid`.
- **Instead:** `sbatch --parsable "$@" | cut -d';' -f1` (`scripts/submit_pipeline.sh`).

### Earlier — `head -3` of a traceback in the env check
- **Tried:** one combined import in `_activate_env.sh`, printing `head -3` on failure.
- **Result:** the three lines printed are exactly the boilerplate; the **fourth** line is the
  `ModuleNotFoundError` naming the package. The first real cluster run was undiagnosable.
- **Instead:** test each package separately and name every missing one.

### Earlier — Bounding `atom_prob` by narrowing the sampling ranges
- **Tried:** tightening the lognormal parameter ranges so recovery would not exceed exposure.
- **Result:** `atom_prob=0.0` still produced 57 % boundary mass; 0.8 gave 93 %.
- **Why:** a lognormal has an **unbounded right tail**. Narrowing ranges cannot bound it — the
  tail is always clipped to the boundary, so mass appears at a boundary that was asked for to be
  empty.
- **Instead:** an explicit `interior_only` clamp (`src/prior/targets/mechanisms.py`). Now
  0.0 → 0 %, 0.6 → 58 %, 1.0 → 99 %.

### Earlier — Out-of-domain regression scored against a `[0,1]` clip
- **Tried:** running the OOD regression suite with raw targets.
- **Result:** a standard-normal target scored **R² = 0.34 on a perfectly linear relationship**.
- **Why:** the regression baselines clip to `[0,1]` because LGD is a loss fraction. An
  arbitrary-scale target is destroyed by that clip, for a reason unrelated to generality.
- **Instead:** min-max the target from **train-only** statistics (`src/eval/ood_runner.py`); R² is
  invariant to a consistent affine transform. Test statistics would leak the test distribution.

### Earlier — Collateral recovery capped before costs
- **Tried:** capping recovery at exposure, then subtracting workout costs.
- **Result:** LGD could never reach exactly 0, so the full-recovery atom was unreachable.
- **Why:** economically backwards — costs come out of the proceeds, and only then is the result
  capped at what is owed.
- **Instead:** costs first, cap second.
